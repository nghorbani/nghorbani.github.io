Education
======
* MSc. Neural Information Processing, Eberhard Karls University, Tübingen, Germany, 2017
* BSc. Electrical Engineering, Electronics, Tabriz Azad University, Tabriz, Iran, 2012

Work Experience
======
* 03.2023 - Present\
  Head of Artificial Intelligence Department\
  Sporttotal Technology GmbH, Cologne, Germany\
  At Sporttotal Technology, we develop AI-powered systems for fully automated sports broadcasting, immersive content generation, and advanced sports analytics. My work spans real-time object detection and tracking on edge devices, human pose estimation, 3D body reconstruction, and identity tracking for sports productions and analytics. Additionally, I contribute to texture generation from sparse image samples using optimization techniques and diffusion-based inpainting, enabling high-fidelity 3D game reconstructions and interactive viewing experiences.

* 04.2021 – 03.2022\
  Staff Applied Research Scientist\
  Kaia Health Software GmbH, Munich, Germany\
  Kaia Health is a digital therapeutics company that leverages AI-powered computer vision to deliver real-time, personalized musculoskeletal care through a smartphone camera. I focused on researching and developing core machine learning models for 3D human pose estimation, motion analysis, and real-time feedback generation. My work enabled accurate human body tracking and automated movement assessments, ensuring users receive guided, AI-driven physical therapy without the need for wearable sensors.

* 02.2018 – 04.2021\
  Research Engineer, Digital Humans in Motion \
  Perceiving Systems Department, Michael Black, Max-Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems, Tübingen, Germany\
  contributed to the development of foundational human body models and large-scale datasets that have significantly advanced the fields of 3D human reconstruction and motion analysis. I worked on SMPL-X, an expressive human body model, and AMASS, a dataset that unifies marker-based motion capture data with parametric body models for large-scale learning. Leveraging these datasets, I helped develop VPoser, a body pose prior facilitating robust 2D-to-3D human body lifting in SMPLify-X. Additionally, I worked on GRAB, a generative model for human grasping, and SOMA, a framework for synthetic data generation to train deep neural networks for human-object interaction understanding.

* 04.2013 – 03.2015\
  Software Engineer, Enterprise Resource Planning Software Development and Implementation, Odoo\
  SuperPipe International Co., Tehran, Iran\
  I led a team of two engineers to implement an open-source ERP software at SPI, based on a tech stack of Python, PostgreSQL, and CSS/HTML. My work involved close collaboration with diverse departments such as finance, HR, warehouse, and inventory to integrate their processes into the ERP. I was supervised by the operational processes department to ensure that industry standards were adapted and integrated into the ERP software for the best implementation impact.
