I am an engineer by nature and a scientist by training. My career interests primarily include machine learning for computer vision and computer graphics with a focus on 3D human body in motion.

Building the future of sports content viewing on the Metaverse is what takes me to work every day as Head of AI at [Sporttotal.tv](https://sporttotal.tv/). Basically we turn human players in images of sport events into motion-accurate, digitized 3D avatar parameters that efficiently enable on-demand immersive 3D viewing of the game and scalable data analysis.

Previously I was an Applied Research Scientist at [Kaia Health GmbH](https://kaiahealth.com/), and before that, I was a Research Engineer at the  [Perceiving Systems Department](https://www.youtube.com/user/BlackAtBrown) of the [Max-Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems](https://www.is.mpg.de/) lead by [Michael Black](https://ps.is.tuebingen.mpg.de/person/black).

I have a BSc. in Electrical Engineering from [Tabriz](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWb1yP-KpMc) Azad University, [Iran](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuITzmlIvbc), and an MSc. in [Neural Information Processing](https://www.neuroschool-tuebingen.de/master/neural-inf-process/) 
from [Eberhard Karls University of TÃ¼bingen](https://www.neuroschool-tuebingen.de/), Germany.
